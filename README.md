OMG, just seen Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy! 🥴 Not gonna lie, I totally 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the   last night thinking it’d be this usual fun flick. But man, it hits you in the feels, doesn’t it? Like, Bridget’s back, and she’s still kinda a mess but in the most relatable way possible. Seriously, how does she manage to live these ridiculous scenarios?! 😂

Anyway, spoiler alert, she gets herself pregnant again (I mean, classic Bridget move, right?) and it’s all frantic and funny, but you gotta give it to her – she’s just rolling with the punches like a champ. And then there’s all this matrix of awkwardness with the two—well, let’s just say love interests, I don’t wanna give it all away. But Colin Firth’s still got it! 😍

> But here’s the kicker, Hugh Grant’s character, like what even went down with him? Totally out of the picture! They just kinda glossed over it, and I’m sitting here like, now hold up, I need closure, people! 📚 I just wanted to sit back and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   with my tea, and now I’m all wrapped up thinking about what’s next. Ugh, Bridget, you do this to me every time.

And can we talk about how real they keep her whole “trying-to-keep-up-with-𝘮𝘰𝘥ern-life” thing? I mean, she’s struggling with texting and social media and all that. Makes me feel a bit seen, TBH. Like, you ever feel your tech’s just kinda running away from you? 😂 Life update (not that you asked): I tried sending an emoji the other day, and it was a total mess. Now I’m immersed in the chaos of keeping plants alive at work AND figuring out the latest iOS. 🙃

int randomCodeLine = 42; // Don't even know why I added this, lol.

Guess I’ll leave it at that. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   if you haven’t already! Anyway, I’m off to attempt some kinda laboratory setup tomorrow, here’s hoping I do it with half the grace Bridget’s got in her chaos. 🌱 Talk later? Peace! ✌️
